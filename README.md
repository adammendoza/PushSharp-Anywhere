DevUG-PushSharp
===============

This project demonstrates the usage/implementation of the PushSharp .NET SDK for simple and efficient management of multiplatform (IOS, Android and Windows Phone) Push Notification services on the server side. 

This solution is consisted from a couple of separate projects including shared processor libraries; a Web .NET WebAPI    app and a Desktop Windows Forms app used for monitoring and handling push notifications as a "state machine".

The repo is also planned to have 3 (iOS, Android and WP8) client implementations connecting to a implemented PushSharp service server.

===============
This demo project was built for a show case on the mscommunity.hr standup/meetup in Zagreb held at 25.11.2014.
